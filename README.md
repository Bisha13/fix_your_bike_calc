This is a project for bike repaire cervice.   
At this moment its uses Spring framework (Boot, Sequrity, WEB MVC, Data) as well as PostgreSQL and deployed to Heroku.

Be patient, it's running on free dynos, so give it time to wake up.   
As you will see, it's uses jQuery for power up sliding menues and other css magic.   
There are some minor Junit test cases, but at this moment there is nothing to look at. There will be more in the future.
